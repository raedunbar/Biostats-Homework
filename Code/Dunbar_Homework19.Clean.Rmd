## Setting up R
```{r}
rm(list=ls())
library(dplyr)
library(here)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
leaves<- read.csv(here("Data for the code", "Class_leaf_measurements.csv"), stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

```

```{r}
str(leaves)
```
this tells me I forgot to do stringsasFactors as they are listed as characters, so I went back up and did that. I also see some dots in the column headings, which need to be fixed. 

## Fixing the column names

lets see what we are dealing with.
```{r}
names(leaves) #shows the column headers
```

lets now fix them using the names function. 
```{r}
names(leaves)<-c("Tree_num", "Species" , "Leaf_num" ,  "DBH_cm", "Petiole_length" , "Total_length_cm", "Middle_lobe_length_cm" , "Middle_lobe_width_cm", "Person" )
```

double checking. 
```{r}
names(leaves)
```

## Fixing Species

species is already a factor variable as I did that above, so I can use levels to see what the data variations  are.
```{r}
levels(leaves$Species)
```
We have 3 norway maples, one spelled wrong, and with a capital m and a lowercase m. Then we have 3 red maples  and 3 sugar maples. So we will have to fix all of those as well. 

### Fixing the norways
```{r}
fix<- which(leaves$Species== "Norway mapel" | leaves$Species== "Norway maple" )
leaves$Species[fix]<- "Norway Maple" # make sure to use the brackets and not the ()! 
```

### Fixing the reds

```{r}
fixred<- which(leaves$Species== "red maple" | leaves$Species== "Red maple")
leaves$Species[fixred]<- "Red Maple" #if I did fix again as my varialbe, we may run into some problems later on if we only run parts of this rmd. 
```
I used Red Maple for datum consistency. 

### Fixing the sugars

```{r}
fixsugar<- which(leaves$Species=="sugar maple" | leaves$Species== "Sugar mapel" | leaves$Species=="Sugar maple")
leaves$Species[fixsugar]<- "Sugar Maple"
```


HERE IS THE CODE THAT FIXES THE LEVELS AFTER YOU DO THE RELEVELING:

```{r}
leaves$Species<-factor(leaves$Species) #reset the factor levels to what are there, so you can get the new ones. 
levels(leaves$Species)
```


## Selecting just the Sugar Maples

```{r}
sugar<- leaves %>% filter(Species=="Sugar Maple")
```

## remove undesired columns
```{r}
sugar<- sugar %>% select(-"Person", -"Leaf_num", -"Tree_num") #select is for columns, slice is for rows, I keep mixing those up!
```

## Make a histogram??

The book's correct methodology. 
```{r}
ggplot(sugar, aes(x=Petiole_length)) + geom_histogram()
# use the ggplot function to take sugar and then aes (wish I knew what this stood for) so the x axis is petiole length. then you tell it to make a histogram. 
```
It is not the prettiest on the block. Soon I reckon we will learn how to spruce it up a bit and get it ready for prom.

HOORAY FOR HISTOGRAM PROM! I  ENJOY YOUR COMMENTS!
